        the
        <b>'src'</b> defines the source or location where the image will be
        gotten from, while the <b>'alt'</b> defines the alternative text to

        <strong>sup and sub</strong> are elements used to create a superscript
        and a sub-script. e.g Today is the 1<sup>st</sup> day the 12<sub
          >th</sub
        >
        month of the year <br />
        <br />
        the element (ul) is used to create unordered list and it is used togther
        with the list element (li). Unordered list is mostly used when
        navigating on going to linked pages. Below is an example of unordered
        listing. <br />
        <br />
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="/BackPage.html">Backpage</a></li>

      in contrast, (ol) is used to create ordered listing. It is also used with
      the list element (li) <br />
      <br />
      Below is an example of ordered listing. <br />
      <br />
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><a href="/BackPage.html">BackPage</a></li>
      <li>No link just an item on the list</li>
      <li>Food</li>
    </ol>
    <br />
    <p>
      a nested list is a list within a list or simply called a sub-list. <br />
      <br />
      example is below <br />
      <br />
    </p>

    <ol>

    <h3>FORMS</h3>
    <p>
      Forms are created by using the (forms) element. When the element is typed,
      (name, id)attributes wld be required in the forms element and those would
      be functional only within the javascript. The (id) attribute is important
      when using labels as the (label) element with a (for) attributewould
      require the input data in the (id) of the forms element. Within the forms
      element, an element input would be required inorder for the user to input
      the required information into the form. After the information has been
      collected, a submit button would be needed to submit the form. Submit can
      be written in two ways, (1) either by using a (button) element and an
      attribute (submit) or by using an (input) element with an attribute
      (type="submit"). <br />
      <br />
      (Input) element is used within the forms element to enable the user add
      inputs into the forms element. With the (input) element, data types such
      as
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>password</li>
      <li>e-mail</li>
      <li>text</li>
      <li>date&time</li>
      <li>etc</li>
    </ul>
    <p>can be collected from the user.</p>
    <br />
    <p>
      (Label) is an element that is used to give a title to a required
      information space. It goes along with the (for) attribute. The data in the
      (for) attribute must match the data in the (id) attribute of the (input)
      element. The paragraph (p) element can also be used in-place of a (label)
      element. <br />
      <br />
      (Placeholder) is an element that is used to display a required information
      to the user inside on a rectangular shape where the user is meant to type
      in the information. With a (Placeholder), the guide would disappear as
      soon as the user starts typing inside the info collector. <br />
      <br />
      (Value) is an attribute that does the same function as the Placeholder but
      the information typed inside of the shape to give the user a guide to what
      is needed does not disappear, the user would have to manually clear it and
      start typing his/her own information. It can also be used to change the a
      title of a button element. (Value) attribute is also used to send a
      required data to the server <br />
      <br />
      (Textarea) element is a big textbox that is used by the user to give more
      information about a a topic. It is followed by (name, id, cols, and rows)
      the cols and rows is used to determine how many rows and column of text is
      needed for the information to be provided. <br />
      <br />
      (Radio and checkbox) attributes are used to allow a user pick an option
      from a listing. The option selected would be sent to the server using the
      (value) attribute. The major difference between the (radio) and (checkbox)
      attribute is that the radio allows only one selection as long as the
      (name) attribute has the same data type while the checkbox allows multiple
      selection. (checked) attirbute is added to the input element if a
      particular option is to be checked by default. <br />
      <br />
      (Select) element is used to great a dropdown menu where list of options
      awould be displayed to the user for selection. The selected option would
      be sent to the server when the submit button is clicked. The (option)
      attribute is written within the (select) element to create a list of
      options for the user to pick from in the dropdown. <br />
      <br />
      Below is how the form element is used.
    </p>
    <br />
    <form action="" id="">
      <label for="name">Name</label> <br />
      <br />
      <input type="text" placeholder="First Name" id="name" />
      <!-- placeholder disappears text while value is hard coded and stays in the input area -->
      <input type="text" value="Last Name" /> <br />
      <br />
      <p>Country</p>
      <input type="text" placeholder="Country of Citizenship" name="" id="" />
      <p>E-mail</p>
      <input
        type="email"
        placeholder="dommy@email.com"
        name=""
        id=""
        required
      />
      <p>Password</p>
      <input
        type="password"
        placeholder="Enter Password"
        name=""
        id=""
        required
      />
      <br />
      <br />
      <!-- Using textarea to collect more info from a user. -->
      <p>More about you</p>
      <textarea
        name=""
        id=""
        cols="30"
        rows="10"
        placeholder="Type in more details about you"
      ></textarea>
      <br />
      <br />
      <!-- using radio and checkbox -->

    <h1>CSS</h1>
    <br />
    <h2>NOTES</h2>
    <!-- Structure/Syntax -->
    <p>
      The syntax of css, should have a the following: selector (element that is
      to be styled e.g h1 element), curly braces({}), declaration block,
      property of the element e.g color, border,font etc, also value for the
      property eg the color of the color property.
    </p>
    <p>There are 3 ways of using CSS, and they are</p>
    <ul>
      <li>CSS</li>
      <li>Internal CSS and</li>
      <li>External CSS</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <br />
    <!-- INLINE STYLING -->
    <h3>INLINE CSS</h3>
    <p>
      Inline css is written inside the tag of the element that is required using
      the element (style), inside the element style, properties/attributes that
      are required such as font, collor, border etc would be declared. Inline
      Css has a downside because it wld be slow and tedious to style every
      single element one after the other. Although it is the strongest of all
      types because if all 3 types are written for a particular element, the
      inline would override the remaining 2. i.e the style declared in the
      inline will be the only active style. eg of inline css is applied below.
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <p
      style="
        border: 2px;
        color: black;
        text-indent: 5%;
        line-height: 20px;
        width: 20%;
        border-style: dotted;
        font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;
        color: red;
        font-weight: bold;
        font-style: normal;

      Inline styling was used to style this text.

    <br />
    <hr />
    <br />
    <!-- INTERNAL STYLING -->
    <h3>INTERNAL CSS</h3>
    <p>
      Internal css is written inside the head element by creating the element
      (style), inside the style element, the element to be styled would be
      declared and then properties that are required for the styling such as
      font, color, border etc would be declared followed by the required values.
      Internal css also has a downside because it wld clog the html document (it
      is not flexible for multiple pages) as compared to the External CSS and
      also every single element in the document would be stlyed one after the
      other. For instance stlyling the h1 element, then image element and any
      other element that requires styling. If an element is styled, the styling
      affect all the elements of the same type written in any part of the HTML
      doc. Although it is stronger than the external css because if they are
      both written for a particular element, the internal css would override the
      external css. i.e the style declared using the internal css will be the
      active style. example of internal css is applied below.
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <h6>THIS HEAD ELEMENT IS STYLED WITH INTERNAL CSS</h6>
    <br />
    <hr />
    <br />
    <!-- EXTERNAL CSS -->
    <h3>EXTERNAL CSS</h3>
    <p>
      External css is written in a different file with the extension (.css), in
      the a different file document and then linked to the html page using a
      (link) element within the head element, (style) element is not needed, the
      elements to be styled are declared and then the required properties and
      value are also declared. For multiple pages, a link to the css should be
      added to the html document if the same styling is needed, instead ot
      copying and pasting styles as in internal css. A semi-colon is used after
      the property before the value is declared i.e (color: red) The below id
      and class heading is styled with external css. <br />
      <br />
      External css can also be used to style a group of elements, a comma (,)
      should be added inbetween the elements e.g (h1,h2), whatever style is
      written inside of the group would be active for all the elements that has
      been grouped.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <!-- IDs -->
    <!-- CSS RULES -->
    <!-- Selectors -->
    <h6>SELECTORS</h6>
    <p>Types of Selectors</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Element Selectors e.g (heading i.e h1-h6, p, ul, ol etc.</li>
      <li>
        Grouping Selectors e.g body, h1,h2(using comma to separate the elements)
      </li>
      <li>ID (#name) Selector</li>
      <li>Class (.name) Selector</li>
    </ol>
    <br />
    <br />
    <!-- CSS INHERITANCE -->
    <h6>CSS INHERITANCE</h6>
    <p>
      inheritance occurs when a style is given to an element and all other
      element inside of the parent element takes/inherits the style of the
      parent element
    </p>
    <!-- Declaration Block: codes within braces { } -->
    <h6>Declaration Block</h6>
    <p>
      Declaration block in css starts with the braces {}. This means that all
      the codes or elements that would be typed inside of the braces are called
      declarations in the braces which signifies the block.
    </p>
    <!-- Declaration of property and the value: semi-colon must be used to close a declaration line -->
    <h6>Declaration properties</h6>
    <p>
      Declaration properties are the elements that would be used for the
      styling, such as colors, border, background etc. all these properties will
      be followed by a colon (:) before the value of the property would be
      declared. After the declaering the value, a semi-colon should be used to
      close the property inorder for the style to effect on the webpage.
    </p>
    <h5>USING ID & CLASS</h5>
    <p>
      IDs are specific names given to an element. These unique names would be
      used to style the element in the css file. ID is mostly used to style
      headers, footers, menu etc. Remember the name attribute of all IDs to be
      used should be unique else IDs of the same name would have the same
      styling. In the CSS file, (#) would be written before the ID name to be
      used. That is the syntax for calling the id. e.g #name{ the style
      properties to be used}.
    </p>
    <p>
      Class works more like IDs but Class is used when focusing on a group of
      elements that would have the same type of styling. It is more flexible and
      time-saving because all the elements that have the same class would be
      have the same styling, in contrast to IDs where each element would have a
      unique name and styled separately. In the CSS file, (.) would be written
      before the ID name to be used e.g .name{ the style properties to be used}.
      ID is mostly used to style group of headers, paragraphs, links etc
    </p>
    <p>
      For instance in a case where there is a lot of elements of same headings
      e.g (10 h3&lt;headings&gt; in a page) class element can be used to style 3
      or 4 of them within one css declaration block but using id, each of the h3
      element would have a unique name and then styled separately in different
      blocks.
    </p>
    <!-- DIV AND SPAN ELEMENTS -->
    <div class="div_span">
      <h6>DIV AND SPAN ELEMENTS</h6>
      <p>
        DIV and SPAN are elements used for grouping. <br />
        <br />
        Div is used to group elements/characters to be styled and the styling
        will take place in a declaration block and the elements within the div
        takes the declared style. Div is a <span>block level</span> element and
        it starts a new line when used. Span on the other hand is an
        <span>inline level</span> element that is used to style characters
        within the body of an element. i.e inline. The Class attribute can also
        be used within <q>divs and spans</q> to give a stlye to a particular
        class of the div or span.
        <span class="green">
          This paragraph is styled with div and also the words in italic,
          including this one, they are styled with the span elements.
        </span>
      </p>
    </div>
    <!-- Last Rule, Specificity, Universal Selector (*) -->
    <h6>Last Rule, Specificity, Universal Selector (*)</h6>
    <p>
      The last rule is where css uses the last rule and add it to the
      stylesheet. The last declaration of same element in css is the only that
      would be applied on the webpage. <br />
      <br />Specificity is the measurement Specificity of elements in css.
      <br />
      <br />Universal selector selects all the elements in the webpage and it
      has the least amount of Specificity. In the stylesheet it starts with (*)
      Selector followed by the curly braces {} then the property(ies) that needs
      reseting. It is mostly used to reset the default browser styles.
    </p>
    <!-- COLORS -->
    <h6>COLOR NAMES (PROPERTIES, RGB, RGBA,HSL, HEX(#), VS_Colors)</h6>
    <p>
      The color property is responsible for the color of the page or elements
      also <em>background-color</em> is also used to color the background of
      either the page, elements or characters. <br />
      <br />There are 140 color names in vs code. A color-name can be used to
      give colors such as red, white, yellow, turquoise etc. <br />
      <br />
      RGB Color is used to get extensive colors within the Red Green Blue colors
      by assigning values between <em>0-255</em> for each of R,G or B in a
      bracket. The syntax is as follows RGB(0-255,0-255,0-255), the values will
      be changed according to the required color. e.g RGB (135,206,235) for
      skyblue color. <br />
      <br />
      Another color name is RGBA which is the same as RGB except for the
      <q>a</q> that is used to determine the opacity/transparency of the color,
      the opacity has a value of <em>0-1</em>. The RGBA is mostly used within
      background-color property. e.g RGBA (255,248,220,0.5) cornsilk color with
      opacity of 0.5. <br />
      <br />
      Another color value is HSL this value is uses the aspect of RGB value but
      the difference is instead of assigning values, HSL uses (%) to determine
      the color to be displayed. <br />
      <br />
      Hexadecimal values is another way to insert colors using hexadecimals of
      alphabets between A-F (A being the least with a value 10 and F being the
      highest with a value 15) and numbers between 1-9. The syntax of using hex
      starts with a (#) then the aplhanumerical values, e.g #ff0000 for color
      red. Note that the hex values should not be more than 6 characters. <br />
      <br />
      VS code offers color variants, it can be used typing the property color
      and then typing any color value, then hover on the color and then a color
      pallete would open up for more color and opacity options. <br />
      <br />
      The following link would navigate you to an external site where you can
      get more cool colors. Use your space bar to go between different color
      pallete.
      <a href="https://coolors.co/" target="_blank">More Colors</a> <br />
      <br />
    </p>
    <h6>CSS UNITS (Font-size, width, height, pixel etc)</h6>
    <p>
      Font-size is used to determine the font size of characters in the element.
      The preferred value should be used in (rem) so that the fonts in the
      webpage can be responsive when the user changes the font size on the web
      browser.
      <br />
      <br />Width and Height is used to determine the width and the height of
      characters in an element. <br />
      <br />
      Pixel(px) is an absolute value of measurement(px for short) that
      determines the measurement of the property selected for the styling. 1
      pixel is equivalent to 1 point on a screen. A pixel value stays the same
      across all screen types in a webpage. <br />
      <br />
      A percentage value (%) is a value used in styling, the % value is a
      relative value of measurement that depends on the parent tags to function.
      It takes the percentage of the absolute measurement style. <br />
      <br />
      Em is also a relative measurement value. 1em = 16px
      <!--(16px is the Default font size for a browser)-->
      The em value depends on the parent tag values. <br />
      <br />
      Rem is also a relative measurement value. The em value depends on the root
      tag values in the webpage i.e HTML tag. <br />
      <br />
      vh & vw are absolute measurement value that takes a percentage of the
      browser screen. They are mostly used to with width and heigh properties to
      style headers and banners. <br />
      <br /><br />
      <br />
      <strong>Default Browser Style and Google DevTools</strong> <br />
      <br />
      To check the default browser styles, go to your browser, right click and
      then click on <em>inspect</em> and on the elements tab to see the default
      browser styles. <br />
      <br />
      Calc() is used to perform math operations in css and also used to mix and
      match values.
    </p>
    <h6 id="typo">Typography</h6>
    <p>
      Typography is the way text is arranged and presented in the webpage.
      <br /><br />
      Font-family is the parent font for similar fonts in a font stack. <br />
      Font-stack is the list of the similar fonts in a font family<br />
      Generic fonts are "serif", "sans-serif", "cursive", "fantasy",
      "monospace". These fonts are the most recognised font family. If the font
      stack in them is not available on a web browser, the browser automatically
      uses fonts that are most similar to the generic font family.<br />
      Google fonts are extra fonts available on google for more design choices.

    <div class="notes">
      <h6>CSS BOX MODEL</h6>
      <p id="notes">
        Css displays elements as a box, three properties are going to be applied
        within the box and those properties are <br />
        1. Padding: This deals with the distance between the content and the
        border edge. Padding values can be written for each sides of the pad,
        although a shorter way of writting the values is by grouping top and
        bottom, giving them same value, if you'd like them to have same value,
        then grouping the left and right sides, also assign a single value. e.g
        Padding: 25px 50px (The 25px applies to the top and bottom while the
        50px applies to the left and right padding.) Another way of writing the
        padding is by assigning different values in the padding element. e.g
        Padding: 10px 20px 30px 40px (10px applies to the top, 20px applies to
        the right, 30px applies to the bottom and then 40px applies to the
        left.)<br />
        <br />
        2. Margin is the distance between content and the edges of the screen or
        some other element. Margin values can be written for each sides of the
        margin, although a shorter way of writting the values is by grouping top
        and bottom, giving them same value, if you'd like them to have same
        value, then grouping the left and right sides, also assign a single
        value. e.g Margin: 25px 50px (The 25px applies to the top and bottom
        while the 50px applies to the left and right padding.) Another way of
        writing the Margin is by assigning different values in the Margin
        element. e.g Margin: 10px 20px 30px 40px (10px applies to the top, 20px
        applies to the right, 30px applies to the bottom and then 40px applies
        to the left.) <br />
        <br />
        Margin with a negative value overlays elements. eg. margin-top:
        <em>-</em>100px. 3. Border is the box that goes around an element.
        Border can be designed with different values, such as the color, width,
        style,radius etc. each and every design can be written on separate
        lines, eg. <br />
        1. border-color: green, <br />2. border-style: solid, <br />3.
        border-width 20px etc.
        <br />
        A shorter way of writing the borders is a single line is to group, the
        style, width and color together. The order of prefference would be width
        value first followed by the style and then the color. eg. border: 20px
        solid green. <br /><br />
        Border-radius is used to make the edges of a border curve. The extent of
        the curve is dependent on the value given to the border-radius property.
        <br />
        Box-sizing with the property of border box
      </p>
    </div>
    <h6>OUTLINE and OFFSET</h6>
    <p>
      Outline is more like a border around a content but the difference between
      border and outline is that with an outline-offset property, the border
      around the element can be moved in and out of the content, given it a
      different look and feel. a negaive value of outline-offset takes the
      border further in while a positive outline takes the border further out.
    </p>
    <br />
    <div class="notes">
      <h6>DISPLAY PROPERTY</h6>
      <p id="notes">
        Block and inline property. A (div) element is a block element. Block
        element always starts a new line and takes full width. <br />
        A (span) is an inline element. An inline doesn't start a new line and
        only take up as much as the content space. <br /><br />When a display
        property is used with an assigned value, it renders the element
        according to the assigned value. For instance is a display peoperty with
        a value of inline in added to a div element, the content will be
        rendered with an inline style as opposed to the default property of a
        div. The same would happen if a display property with the value block is
        added to a span element. The contents would be rendered with a block
        style. <br /><br />
        Horizontal centering is for aligning elements to the center. For inline
        elements, the text align property can be used to align the text but for
        block level elements, margin with a value of auto for the left and the
        right would align the contents of the block elements to the left. <br />
        <br />Browsers respect top bottom margin and padding for block elements
        but doesn't for inline element. <br /><br />list-style-type is an
        element used to style the numbering of un-ordered list (ul), for links
        in a list (ul or ol) to have top and bottom margin, first the display
        property has to be set to block because it is by default an inline style
        and browers do not render top and bottom margin for inline elements.
        <br /><br />Inline-block is a property used with display element to make
        an inline element render a top and bottom margin by making the element a
        block property while maintaining it's inline position. <br /><br />
        Display property set to a value of none makes an element disappear from
        the browser page, the element with this property would not be displayed
        on the webpage and devtools. <br /><br />
        Opacity is an element that has a value between 0-1, it used to set the
        transparency level of an element. Just like <q>a</q>in rgba value of the
        color element, but this time, it is applied to elements.<br /><br />Visibility
        element is used to make an element visible or hidden from the webpage
        but in devtools it will be evident that there is an element not
        displaying on the webpage.

        Gradients are used to add overlays for background images. The
        linear-gradient() is the value of the background propert in CSS that
        creates an image consisting of a progressive transition between two or
        more colors along a straight line. Its result is an object of the
        gradient data type, which is a special kind of image. The () is where
        the degree and colors of progressive transition would be written.
        <br /><br />
        Note that you can style your background image inside the linear gradient
        property instead of writting all of the background properties. The
        background styling should follow this order: postion/size repeat and
        then attachment. e.g linear-gradient (rgba(0,2,5,0.3), rgba(5,2,4,0.25),
        url(the image path) center/cover no-repeat fixed). <br />

        Responsive design involves styling elements to display on different
        screen sizes using Min-width and Max-width. Where min-width is used to
        determine from what size of the screen the element style would display
        and max-width is used to determine up to what screen size the style
        would be displayed. Note that any mistake (even a space between letters)
        in the media query syntax would prevent the style from rendering. You
        will see the effects of media query on this paragraph if your screen
        size gets smaller. <br />
        <br />

        Z-index (Z-axis): This property places elements, images to be precise
        behind or in front of another image depending on the attributed value
        with zero (0) being the default value. A positive value brings an image
        to the front while a negative values takes it behind another. Below is
        the resulting effect of a <em>z-index on an image.</em>
      </p>

      <h3>Pseudo Elements (::)</h3>
      <p class="pseudo">
        is used to insert contents inline <em>before and after</em> an element
        and also to style the first-line / first-letter of a paragraph. The
        syntax should be (element::before or after{content:" characters "
        followed by the styling properties.} for the before and after then
        p::first-letter{} and p::first-line{} ) It is mostly used on an image
        design. For pseudo styling, the property <em>content</em> is required
        even if it to be left empty without characters. Also before and after
        doesn't work with an image element.

      <h3>PSEUDO CLASSES (:)</h3>
      <p>
        The syntax for a pseudo element would be (element:pseudo style{styling
        properties} e.g p:hover{styling properties}). Below a few pseudo classes
        would be explained with examples embedded in them.
      </p>
      <p id="pseudoHover">
        First we would look at the Hover class (:hover) The hover is a class in
        the pseudo element styling that makes the state of an element change
        when the mouse is hovered over the element in the webpage and the chnage
        would be based on the pseudo property used under the the hover class.
        Hover can be used on any element including links (a) An example where it
        used on links would be seen when you hover over the header above that
        contains links..
      </p>
      <p>
        Link, visited link and hover link and active link <br />
        Link pseudo class is used to design links in the webpage, given them a
        particular design to identify them as links. The syntax for wrriting it
        in the css file is (element(class/id):link{styling properties}). <br />
        <br />
        Visited link pseudo class is used to stlye a link, identifying that the
        link has been visited before. The link could have an identifying
        property such as color or text design or whatever the programmer wishes
        to use as an identifier. The syntax would be
        (element(class/id):visited{styling property}). <br />
        <br />Pseudo Hover class is the same as explained
        <a href="#pseudoHover">above.</a> We would only use it here to style
        link elements to add a style when it is being hovered in the webpage.
        <br />
        <br />
        Active is used to style active links in the sense that it would give a
        style when overed on, to show that the mouse is on the link to be
        clicked and the syntax would be (element(class/id):active{styling
        property}). <br />
        This classes has been used in the header above for the links. Explore
        the links on the header to see the styles. <br />
        <br />
        Pseudo Class (Root) is used to style the root element which is the HTML
        tag in this case, the root class is used to style the full HTML document
        as any style that is written in the root class, would be applied to the
        whole page. It is usally used to modify element property values such as
        background color, paragraph text size, etc.

    <div class="selectors">
      <h3>Selectors</h3>
      <p>Basic Selectors</p>
      <ul>
        <li>* reset selector</li>

      <h3>Descendant/Child Combinator</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Descendant and child combinator is used to select all of the same
          Descendant element in the div or any other parent tag or class or id
          of the element. <br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>All the h3 elements in this div are descendant elements.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The syntax is given in the list below</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          element descendant tag { } followed by the style properties. <br />
          Also the symbol ( > ) is used to style the direct child of an element
          or class.
        </li>
        <li>
          div h1 {} -- This syntax is used to style all the h1 elements within
          the div.
        </li>
        <li>
          div > h1 {} -- This syntax is used to style the direct h1 of the div
          element.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div id="TransForm">
      <h3>TRANSFORM & ANIMATION</h3>
      <p>
        Transform property is usually used to arrange divs around the webpage,
        inorder to move the div to other places in the webpage, the property
        transform would be used with the value translate(). <br />
        <br />
        <span>Transform translateX/Y</span> is used for the direction. X with a
        positive value moves the div to the right while a negative value moves
        the div to the left. Y with a positive value moves the div to the bottom
        while a negative value moves the div to the top. The box below was moved
        with a transform property in the CSS file. The property for the syntax
        would be (transform: translateX/Y(Value)). The shorthand for X/Y would
        be transform: translate(X_value, Y_value). <br />
        <br />
        <span>Transform scale</span> is another value used to resize the scale
        of the div element, i.e it makes the div smaller or bigger depending on
        the value used, the default value is (1), to scale smaller, the value
        has to be below 1 e.g (0.9 and lower), to scale bigger, the value would
        be above 1 e.g (1.1 and above). The syntax is (transform:
        scaleX/Y(value)).The shorthand for X/Y would be transform:
        scale(X_value, Y_value). <br />
        <br />
        <span>Transform rotateZ</span> is used to rotate the div element based
        on the inputted degree. The syntax is (transform:
        rotateZ(Value_deg)).The shorthand would be transform: rotate(Value_deg).
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>Trasform SkewX/Y</span> is used to make the div element
        skew/slant. The syntax is (transform: skewX/Y(Value_deg)). The syntax is
        (transform: skewX/Y(Value_deg)).The shorthand for X/Y would be
        transform: scale(X_value_deg, Y_value_deg). The below div elements has
        all the transform property.
      </p>

    <!-- TRANSITIONS -->
    <div id="TransI">
      <h3>TRANSITION</h3>
      <p>
        Transition is used to create a state of change to an element within a
        period of time. Change over time. Transition is used with the hover
        pseudo class to display the transition when the element is hovered on.
        Transition moves from 0-100% i.e back and forth.
        <br />
        <br />
        Transition-property is the property used to input the required
        transition property such as background color, border-radius, color,
        font-size, transform etc. The properties required when hovered would be
        written inside the pseudo hover class of the element. An example is
        given below. <br />
        <br />
        div.TransI { <br />
        margin: 0 50px; <br />
        width: 150px;<br />
        height: 200px;<br />
        font-weight: bold;<br />
        display: inline-block;<br />
        }<br />
        div#wife {<br />
        background: url(../HTML/images/wife.jpg);<br />
        background-size: 100%;<br />
        transition-property: background border;<br />
        transition-duration: 5s;<br />
        transition-timing-function: linear;<br />
        }<br />
        div#wife:hover {<br />
        background: url(../HTML/images/Modella.jpeg);<br />
        background-size: cover;<br />
        border-radius: 50%;<br />
        }<br />
        The effect of the css transition is shown in the pictures below. Place
        your mouse over the images to see the transition.
      </p>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div id="wife" class="TransI"></div>

    <br />
    <!-- ANIMATIONS -->
    <div>
      <h3>ANIMATION</h3>
      <p>
        Animation is quite similar to transition but the major difference is
        transition goes from a state of 0-100% but animation states can be
        specified. The syntax for animation would be @keyframes animation_name {
        styling properties } after which the name of the animation, duration and
        count would be written in the element styling. An example of animation
        styling is given below.
      </p>
      <p class="examples">
        .anime { <br />
        margin: 10px 75px; <br />
        width: 175px; <br />
        height: 250px; <br />
        display: inline-block; <br />

        60% { <br />
        transform: rotate(250deg); <br />
        } <br />
        70% { <br />

        background-size: cover; <br />
        } <br />
        90% { <br />
        transform: translateX(200px); <br />
        } <br />
        100% { <br />
        transform: translate(10px 50px); <br />
        } <br />
        } <br />
        Below is the effect of the style.

    <div id="pro" class="anime"></div>
    <div id="angel" class="anime"></div>
    <div id="beaut" class="anime"></div>
    <br />
    <p>
      Animation fill mode is used to define the values outside of the animation.
      With animation fill mode and a value of <em>forward</em>, the animation
      takes stays with the final property and value that has been specified at
      the end of the keyframe, which might be at 100% instead of returning back
      to the starting position and value.

    <!-- CSS VARIABLES -->
    <div>
      <h3 id="var">CSS VARIABLES</h3>
      <p>
        Css variables gives a flexibilty in the html document. It is used to
        store properties and values that can be reused in the throught out the
        document. The syntax is given as follows: --varName:value. To use it,
        the syntax for use would be property:var(--varName). There are two types
        of scopes for the variable, that is global and local. The global
        variables are setup in the pseudo_root_element (:root{}), the local one
        is set up in specific elements

      <h3>FontAwesome Icons</h3>
      <p>
        FontAwesome is a free icon service provider. Icons can be downloaded
        from
        <a href="https://fontawesome.com/start" target="_blank">here</a> and
        used in the HTML document. <br />
        .fab { <br />

      <h3 id="textShadow">Text/Box-Shadow</h3>
      <p>
        Text/box shadow is is used to add shadows to a text or a box element.
        The syntax for styling an element to have a shadow is: text-shadow:
        x-axis value, y-axis value, blurr and color. The values define the way
        the shadow renders. Below is an example of the css code used to style
        the heading above. <br />
        <em>text-shadow: 0px 5px 5px grey;</em> <br />
        Below is an example of box shadow used <a href="#modella">here</a>
        <br />
        <em>
          box-shadow: /*rightside */ 5px /*Bottom*/ 15px /*opacity*/ 20px
          /*around*/ 5px grey; </em

      <h3>Browser Prefixes</h3>
      <p>
        Brower prefixes are the ways for different browsers to add support for
        the latest CSS features. They are needed for compatibility of webpages
        across all browsers. It is also known as Vendor prefixes. An external
        resource that is helpful is
        <a href="https://caniuse.com/" target="_blank">caniuse.com</a> <br />
        This is an example of what browser prefixes look like:
        <em>
          <strong>-webkit</strong>-box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px 0px
          rgba(0,0,0,0.75); <strong>-moz</strong>-box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px 0px
          rgba(0,0,0,0.75); box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px 0px rgba(0,0,0,0.75); </em
        >. You can copy and paste your code
        <a href="https://autoprefixer.github.io/" target="_blank">here</a> to
        have the code prefixed.
      </p>
      <br />
      <!-- Semantic HTML -->
      <h3>Semantic HTML</h3>
      <p>
        This is where you use specific element to structure HTML contents
        instead of using div, span, etc. Semantic tags provide a better
        structure for the webpage. The image below shows a few semantic tags.
      </p>
      <img src="./images/semantic_tags.png" alt="an image of semantic_tags" />
      <br />
      <h3>Emmet Snippets</h3>
      <p>
        Emmet is a set of plug-ins for text editors that allow for high-speed
        coding and editing in HTML. To learn more about emmet snippets. Go here:
        <a href="https://docs.emmet.io/cheatsheet-a5.pdf" target="_blank"
          >Emmet snippets</a
        >. <br />
        Emmet shortcut can be used to create a div that has a class and a tag
        without having to type them the traditional way. E.g Clicking enter
        after typing <q>.header#sidenote</q> will display as this
        <em> &lt;div class="header" id="sidnote"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; </em>. Where
        (#) declares the id and (.) declares the class. <br />
        Another example is a shortcut for creating a listing. <br />
        div>ul>li*3. Where (>) declares the child (li) in the (ul) in the
        ancestor (div), and (*) decalres how many list tags would be rendered.
        The ruslt would be like this <br />
        <em>
          &lt;div&gt; <br />
          &lt;ul&gt; <br />
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt; <br />
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt; <br />
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt; <br />
          &lt;/ul&gt; <br />
          &lt;/div&gt; <br />

        Flexbox stands for <q>Flexible box</q> is a display type that acomes
        with properties that allow you to arrange items easily. It is an very
        good alternative to float property. It is divided into container and
        items. The container can be in form of a div element. <br />
        <br />

      <div class="Flexitems">K</div>
      <div class="Flexitems">L</div>
      <div class="Flexitems">M</div>
      <div class="Flexitems">N</div>
      <div class="Flexitems">O</div> -->
    </div>
    <p>
      <em>Flex direction</em> makes the content of the flex align either in a
      column or a row. Although column is the default one. We also have values
      such as row-reverse while reverses the order of the items in a row of the
      flex container. Also column-reverse whihc also reverses the items but in a
      column. The syntax is given below. <br />
      flex-direction: row; <br />
      flex-direction: row-reverse; <br />
      flex-direction: column; <br />
      flex-direction: column-reverse; <br />
      You use the flex direction and wrap only after the display has been set to
      flex.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Flex Wrap</em> is a property that pushes the flex items to the next
      line so as not to have continous unbroken line of characters. The syntax
      is: <br />
      flex-wrap: wrap; (This wraps the content to the next line) <br />
      flex-wrap: nowrap; (This is the default value of the html document. The
      items stay on a single line without moving to the next.) <br />
      flex-wrap: wrap-reverse; (This value wraps the items in a reverse order.
      It takes the test above the line of characters instead of below it.
      Inorder words the line before and not after.)
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two main elements that are used to justify and align flex items
      inside the container. These elements contain 3 main values and 2 special
      values which aligns them in a very different pattern. The first would be:
      <br />
      <em>justify-content</em>: this property aligns the flex items horizontally
      and the 3 main values are: Flex-end (right hand side), <br />
      Flex-Start(Left hand side) and <br />
      Center(middle). <br />
      The special values are: <br />
      Space-between (creates equal spaces between the flex items.) and <br />
      Space-around (creates spaces around all the items in the conatainer,
      including the edges, more like margin all around.) <br />
      <em>align-items</em>: this property aligns items vertically and the 3 main
      values are the same as does with justify-content. That is:
      <br />
      Flex-end (bottom), <br />
      Flex-Start(top) and <br />
      Center(middle). <br />
      The special values are: <br />Baseline (This value keeps the items on the
      same baseline no matter the font size or height of the property.) and
      <br />
      Stretch (This is the default value of the flex where the item is streched
      from top to botton of the flex container)
    </p>
    <p>
      Flex Item Order is used to change how the items are positioned or ordered
      in the container. The syntax would be to add an inline style to the items
      and use the property <q>order: ;</q> the value would range from 1 to the
      number of items that are in the container. 0 can not be used as it is the
      default value that keeps the items in their original order. Below is an
      example of the syntax: <br />
      <em>
        style="order: 5" A <br />
        style="order: 4" B <br />
        style="order: 3" C <br />
        style="order: 1" D <br />
        style="order: 2" E <br />
      </em>
    </p>
    <div class="flexContainer">
      <div class="Flexitems" style="order: 5">A</div>
      <div class="Flexitems" style="order: 4">B</div>
      <div class="Flexitems" style="order: 3">C</div>
      <div class="Flexitems" style="order: 1">D</div>
      <div class="Flexitems" style="order: 2">E</div>
    </div>
    <br />

    <h3>SHRINK/GROW AND BASIS</h3>
    <p>
      These properties are responsible for the responsiveness of flexbox. <br />
      <br />
      Flex Basis defines the minimum width of a flex item. The value can be any
      number in pixels. <br /><br />
      Flex-grow defines the same amount of extra space between items in a
      flex-box. Set Flex grow to 1 for all items in the flex if they are to have
      the same amount of extra space but if one item will have a defined amount
      extra space, set the value of the item to 1 while others retain the
      default value which is 0. <br /><br />
      Flex-shrink defines the rate of shrinkage of each item relative to the
      rest of the items and the default value is 1. Set the value of flex shrink
      to zero if a particular item in the box will not be shrinked when the
      minimum shrink of the webpage is reached. A value above 1 makes the item
      shrink as many times as the defined value.For instance, if the value of a
      flex-shrink is set to 3, it means the item that has that value would
      shrink 3 times faster than the remaining items in the flex. <br />
      These flex itmes are very important as it helps the webpage to be
      responsive to any device or size of screen that it would be displayed on.
      Below is an example of the effect of the flex grow,shrink and basis
      properties. <br />
      <br />
      &lt;div class="Flexitems" style="flex-grow: 1; flex-shrink: 0; flex-basis:
      30%" &gt; G &lt;/div&gt; <br />
      &lt;div class="Flexitems" style="flex-grow: 1; flex-shrink: 2; flex-basis:
      15%" &gt; H &lt;/div&gt; <br />
      &lt;div class="Flexitems" style="flex-grow: 5; flex-shrink: 3; flex-basis:
      10%" &gt; I &lt;/div&gt; <br />
      &lt;div class="Flexitems" style="flex-grow: 1; flex-shrink: 1; flex-basis:
      15%" &gt; J &lt;/div&gt; <br />
      &lt;div class="Flexitems" style="flex-grow: 1; flex-shrink: 5; flex-basis:
      10" &gt; K &lt;/div&gt; <br />
      &lt;/div&gt; <br />
      <br />
      A shorthand can be used for the code written above. Flex property is the
      element that will be used to write the shorthand for the code. The syntax
      is: <em>Flex: grow(value) shrink(value) basis(value) </em> e.g: &lt;div
      class="Flexitems" style="<strong>flex: 1 2 15%"</strong>&gt;H&lt;/div &gt;
    </p>
    <div class="flexContainer">
      <div
        class="Flexitems"
        style="flex-grow: 1; flex-shrink: 0; flex-basis: 30%"
      >
        G
      </div>
      <div class="Flexitems" style="flex: 1 2 15%">H</div>
      <div
        class="Flexitems"
        style="flex-grow: 5; flex-shrink: 3; flex-basis: 10%"
      >
        I
      </div>
      <div
        class="Flexitems"
        style="flex-grow: 1; flex-shrink: 1; flex-basis: 15%"
      >
        J
      </div>
      <div
        class="Flexitems"
        style="flex-grow: 1; flex-shrink: 5; flex-basis: 10"
      >
        K
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      Using align-self to arrange each item in the flex-box. An example is shown
      below. <br />
      &lt;div class="flexContainer"&gt; <br />
      &lt;div class="Flexitems" style="order: 5; align-self:
      flex-start;"&gt;A&lt;/div&gt; <br />
      &lt;div class="Flexitems" style="order: 4;
      align-self:center;"&gt;B&lt;/div&gt; <br />
      &lt;div class="Flexitems" style="order: 3;
      align-self:flex-end;"&gt;C&lt;/div&gt; <br />
      &lt;div class="Flexitems" style="order: 1;
      align-self:flex-start;"&gt;D&lt;/div&gt; <br />
      &lt;div class="Flexitems" style="order: 2;
      align-self:center;"&gt;E&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; <br />
    </p>

    <div class="flexContainer">
      <div class="Flexitems" style="order: 5; align-self: flex-start">A</div>
      <div class="Flexitems" style="order: 4; align-self: center">B</div>
      <div class="Flexitems" style="order: 3; align-self: flex-end">C</div>
      <div class="Flexitems" style="order: 1; align-self: flex-start">D</div>
      <div class="Flexitems" style="order: 2; align-self: center">E</div>
    </div>
    <h4>GRID</h4>
    <p>
      Grid is a display type that can be used to activate certain layout
      features on a container element. The major difference between grids and
      flexbox: grid is more manual that flexbox, grid focuses on both width and
      height while flex focuses majorly on the width of the flex items. <br />
      <br />
      Template rows and columns can be created in the container, the properties
      for creating rows and columns is
      <em>grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows</em>.
      grid-template-columns: 50px 50px 10px; This property specifies the number
      of rows/columns that the grid container would be divided into. The number
      of values inputted determines the number of rows/columns that will be in
      the grid. Using auto as the value for rows and columns would be the
      perfect value, as it would make the grid responsive to any device and also
      divides the items evenly in the grid container. Note the number of auto
      defined in the value, determines the number of rows/columns that would be
      created. <br />
      <em>justify-content</em>: this property aligns the grid items horizontally
      and the 3 main values are: end (right hand side), <br />
      Start(Left hand side) and <br />
      Center(middle). <br />
      The special values are: <br />
      Space-evenly (creates even spaces between the grid items.) and <br />
      Space-around (creates spaces around all the items in the conatainer,
      including the edges, more like margin all around.) <br />
      <em>align-content</em>: this property aligns items vertically and the 3
      main values are the same as does with justify-content. That is:
      <br />
      end (bottom), <br />
      Start(top) and <br />
      Center(middle). <br />
      <br />
      <em>grid-column-start/end</em> is used to determine a grid item's size and
      location within the grid by contributing a line, a span, or nothing
      (automatic) to its grid placement. <br />
      <br />
      <em>grid-area</em> is a shorthand for grid-column/row-start/end that
      determine a grid item's size (by adding span after the slash before the
      next value) and location within the grid by contributing a line, a span,
      or nothing (automatic) to its grid placement. Shorthand for
      'grid-row-start', 'grid-column-start', 'grid-row-end', and
      'grid-column-end'. <br />
      Below is an example of a CSS code used to style the grid items and the
      container. <br /><br />
      Container <br />
      #grid { <br />
      background: #5b62c9; <br />
      margin: 10px; <br />
      height: 300px;<br />
      display: grid; /*This property and value is used to change the default
      dispaly of the div tag container to a grid*/ <br />
      grid-template-columns: auto auto auto; This property specifies the number
      of columns that the grid container would be divided into.
      grid-template-rows: auto auto; }<br />
      <br />
      Items <br />
      .grid { <br />
      margin: 10px; <br />
      color: white; <br />
      font-size: 1.5rem; <br />
      line-height: 40px; <br />
      width: 70px; <br />
      text-align: center; <br />
      }
    </p>
